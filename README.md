# Otp-Verification
🔐 OTP Verification Web Page
This project is a OTP Verification web page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates the user experience of entering and verifying a One-Time Password (OTP) Ideal for UI/UX demos or integrating later with a real backend or API.

✅ Features
📲 Mobile-friendly and responsive OTP input UI

🔢 4-digit / 6-digit OTP input fields

🧾 Form validation and input restrictions

✨ Smooth UX with focus shift and animations

🎨 Modern and clean design using HTML & CSS

🚫 No backend – purely frontend simulation

🧰 Tech Stack:
HTML5 – Structure

CSS3 – Styling and layout

JavaScript – Input handling and UX logic

🚀 How It Works:
User enters a phone number or email (optional UI)

Enters OTP manually (no actual OTP is sent)

Clicks “Verify” – JS checks for correct format

Shows a success/failure message (simulated)
